# Description
HotSpot is a pre-RTL thermal simulator intended for use early in the design process. HotSpot supports simulation of traditional 2D Integrated Circuits (2D ICs) and [3D ICs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_integrated_circuit) as well as  [microfluidic cooling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microfluidics). If this is your first time seeing HotSpot, check out our [Getting Started](https://github.com/uvahotspot/HotSpot/wiki/Getting-Started) page. To see HotSpot in action, check out our simulation examples in the `examples` directory! Please send questions, comments, concerns, bugs, etc. to hotspot@virginia.edu.
# Project
This project is for Low Power Computing. This assignment is to see how temperature varies by floorplanning (grid and block), what are pros and cons for each floorplanning, and how can we improve them. Please read pdf file that is report for project, and it is written in Korean. If you want English version, please contact me. (zeju00@korea.ac.kr)
